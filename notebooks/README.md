# Notebooks

This set of notebooks steps through the project, and creates all the figures that are in the paper.

### 0-BandRatios-Introduction

This notebook introduces band ratios and how to calculate them, as well as introducing the FOOOF model.

### 1-Literature Search

This notebook does an automated literature search of band ratio terms and associations, to map out how band ratio measures are used in the literature.

### 2-BandRatios-Conflation

This notebook simulates power spectra to demonstrate how changing spectral features could yield the same ratio measure.

### 3-Simulation-Generation

This notebook walks through how spectra were simulated, and example simulated spectra. Simulations include single parameter variations and interacting parameter variations.

### 4-Simulation-Analysis

This notebook calculates ratios measures on the previously generated simulated data, and plots the results.

### 5-EEGDataset-Analysis

This notebook analyzes an EEG dataset to explore relationships between spectral features and band ratios measures.

### 6-EEGDataset-Topographies

This notebook creates topographies for spectral features and ratio measures.

### A1-SpectralRotations

In this notebook we explore the effects on band ratios when we rotate power spectra.
